Credits just slightly exceed debits but there is insufficient liquidity, minimal savings, and potential over-reliance on irregular funds. High transaction volume with average low monthly balances suggests a scenario of income to debt parity, tipping towards liabilities. Risk indicators such as overdraft usage and non-sustainable saving levels present a high risk for loan servicing without additional income stabilization.",
